                    <p>
                        Hour of Code is a global event that aims to introduce individuals, especially students, to the basics of computer programming. 
                        Before arranging our event, we learned how to organize an Hour of Code from the official website. Following their guidance, 
                        we contacted Baku Secondary School No. 329, provided detailed information about the event, and obtained permission to host it.
                        Afterward, we registered our event on the Hour of Code site, selected <b>Minecraft Adventurer</b> as the activity, 
                        and planned every detail, including setting the date and creating a schedule.

                        The event was held on <strong>November 1st, 2024, at 11:00</strong>, at Baku Secondary School No. 329. 
                        28 students from the 6th grade participated, most of whom were beginners. Only 10% had heard about Hour of Code before. 
                        The event was divided into three parts:
